SQL - Additional Queries
In this project, I continued to practice SQL queries, focusing on permissions, joins, and constraints.

Usage üê¨
Execute the script 3-force_name.sql to direct the database for querying. Provide the database to query from as a MySQL command line argument:

shell
Copy code
$ cat 3-force_name.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0d_2
Execute Tasks 10-101 by querying the database using hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql.

Execute Tasks 102-103 by querying the database using hbtn_0d_tvshows_rate.sql.
